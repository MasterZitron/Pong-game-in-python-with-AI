# Pong-game-in-python-with-AI
its a bad pong game but it work

you need Pygame for it to work

I added 2 types of AI to this game, the first one moves based on the balls position
The second one tries to predict where it will go based on the balls velocity (Spoiler alert: it sucks, and its essentially the first ai)
